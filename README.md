# Data Visualization on Formula 1

Correlation analysis between qualifying position and race finish position

Using Jupyter Notebook, I created a simple data pipeline that pulls from [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd/) to generate a visual that evaluates Formula 1 drivers' performance.

At every race, drivers have to complete a qualifying lap on Saturday and race on the next day. Qualifying result will determine the position of the grid for the race. This analysis will serve the function to observe the relationship between the two-day results.

Final product is then visualized using the Seaborn library ```sns.heatmap()```

Final result:
